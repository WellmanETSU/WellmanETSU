- 👋 Hi, I’m @WellmanETSU
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and Analysis in a broad sense, but I'm more interested in how we can leverage and understand data to make real strides towards the creation of a more just and verdant world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning so much! I'm focusing on Python with Codeacademy, but also working through Harvard's CS50x and will probably also do TOR.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to education, my primary field of expertise.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I'm at jcball89@gmail and @mr_jball on Twitter.
